instructions: |
    Put the egg yolks into a bowl, finely grate in the Parmesan, season with
    pepper, then mix well with a fork and put to one side. Cut any hard skin off
    the pancetta and set aside, then chop the meat.

    Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente.
    Meanwhile, rub the pancetta skin, if you have any, all over the base of a
    medium frying pan (this will add fantastic flavour, or use 1 tablespoon of
    oil instead), then place over a medium-high heat. Crush the garlic clove
    with the palm of your hand, add it to the pan and leave it to flavour the
    fat for a minute. Stir in the pancetta, then cook for 4 minutes, or until
    it starts to crisp up.

    Pick out and discard the garlic from the pan, then, reserving some of the
    cooking water, drain and add the spaghetti. Toss well over the heat so it
    really soaks up all that lovely flavour, then remove the pan from the heat.
    Add a splash of the cooking water and toss well, season with pepper, then
    pour in the egg mixture – the pan will help to cook the egg gently, rather
    than scrambling it. Toss well, adding more cooking water until it’s lovely
    and glossy. Serve with a grating of Parmesan and an extra twist of pepper.
tips:

      Use ready-sliced quality pancetta if you can’t buy it in one piece. It’s
      traditional to use spaghetti in this recipe, but bucatini or rigatoni are
      just as good.
